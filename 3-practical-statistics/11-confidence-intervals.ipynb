However, it is also important to take into consideration practical significance in making decisions. Practical significance takes into consideration other factors of your situation that might not be considered directly in the results of your hypothesis test or confidence interval. Constraints like space, time, or money are important in business decisions. However, they might not be accounted for directly in a statistical test.\n",
